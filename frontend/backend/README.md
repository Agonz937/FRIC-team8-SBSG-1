# FRIC Backend

## Instructions
To initialize the mongoDB server through Mongoose you must have `mongoDB` installed on your system.

a) To start the database server:
  1. Run the command `mongod`
  2. Ensure that you are in the *backend* folder.
  3. Run the command `node server.js`

b) To install mongoDB:
  1. Run apt-get update
  2. Run apt-install mongoose
  3. After installing mongoose you can proceed to step (a).

The connection to the database should now be established. You can access the database using a tool like TablePlus or some other DBMS.
Preferably MongoDBCompass, copy and paste `mongodb://localhost/Eventdb` onto the new connection portion of mongoDBCompass.
