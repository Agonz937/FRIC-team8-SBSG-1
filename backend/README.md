# FRIC Backend

## Instructions
To initialize the mongoDB server through Mongoose you must have `mongoDB` installed on your system. 

To start the database server:
1. Run the command `mongod`
2. Ensure that you are in the *backend* folder.
3. Run the command `node server.js`

The connection to the database should now be established. You can access the database using a tool like TablePlus or some other DBMS.
